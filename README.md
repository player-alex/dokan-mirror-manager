## 📋 Requirements

- 🪟 **Windows 10/11** (x64)
- 🔷 **.NET 8.0 Runtime** - [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- 📦 **[Dokan Driver](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/releases)** - User mode file system library for Windows
- 🔑 **Administrator privileges** - Required for mount operations

## 📥 Installation

1. **Download** the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. **Install** [Dokan Driver](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/releases) if not already installed
3. **Extract** the downloaded archive
4. **Run** `dokan-mirror-manager.exe` as Administrator

> ⚠️ **Important**: The application must be run with Administrator privileges to perform mount operations.

## 📖 Usage

### ➕ Adding a Mount

1. Click the **Add** button
2. Select a source directory or drive using the folder browser
3. A drive letter is **automatically assigned** from available letters
4. Optionally enable **Auto Mount** to automatically mount on application startup
5. **Read Only** mode is enabled by default for safety
6. Click the **Mount** 📂 button to mount the drive

### 🔄 Mounting/Unmounting

- **Mount**: Click the folder open icon (📂) next to the mount item
- **Unmount**: Click the folder remove icon (🗑️) next to the mounted item
  - Shows elapsed time during unmount: "Unmounting Z:\... (5s)"
  - If unmount takes longer than expected (>10s), displays timeout dialog with options
  - Can continue in background if needed

### ❌ Removing a Mount

1. Select an **unmounted** item from the list
2. Click the **Remove** button

> 💡 **Tip**: You cannot remove a mounted drive. Unmount it first.

### 🎯 System Tray

- **Minimize**: Close the window to minimize to system tray (shows notification)
- **Restore**: Click the tray icon or launch the application again
- **Exit**: Right-click tray icon → Exit (prompts to unmount drives)

### 🔐 Single Instance

The application runs as a single instance. If you try to launch it while already running:
- If **visible**: Nothing happens (already running)
- If **in tray**: Window automatically restores and comes to front

## 🛠️ Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- 🔧 **Visual Studio 2022** or later (or VS Code with C# extension)
- 🔷 **.NET 8.0 SDK** - [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- 📦 **Dokan Driver** (for testing) - [Download](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/releases)

### Build Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/player-alex/dokan-mirror-manager.git
cd dokan-mirror-manager

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the project (Release configuration)
dotnet build -c Release

# Or build for x64 specifically
dotnet build -c Release --arch x64
```

### Run from Source

```bash
# Run as Administrator (required for Dokan operations)
dotnet run --project dokan-mirror-manager/dokan-mirror-manager.csproj
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: Must be run as Administrator for Dokan operations.

### 📦 Building as Library

The project includes `Loader.cs.example` which demonstrates how to use DokanMirror as a library:

1. Change `OutputType` in `.csproj` from `WinExe` to `Library`
2. Rename `Loader.cs.example` to `Loader.cs`
3. Build the project - it will produce `DokanMirror.dll`
4. Call `__Launch__` from your native code to start the application

See [Loader.cs.example](dokan-mirror-manager/Loader.cs.example) for C/C++ usage examples.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Mount configurations are automatically saved to `mounts.json` in the application directory.

**Configuration includes:**
- 📁 Source paths (supports environment variables)
- 💾 Destination drive letters
- 🤖 Auto-mount settings
- 🔒 Read-only settings

The configuration file is created automatically on first mount and updated whenever changes are made.

### Environment Variables

You can use Windows environment variables in source paths within `mounts.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "SourcePath": "%USERPROFILE%\\Desktop",
    "DestinationLetter": "Z:\\",
    "AutoMount": true,
    "IsReadOnly": true
  }
]
```

**Supported variables:**
- `%USERPROFILE%` - User's home directory
- `%APPDATA%` - Application data folder
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%` - Local application data folder
- `%ProgramFiles%` - Program Files directory
- `%TEMP%` - Temporary files directory
- Any other Windows environment variables

### Smart Drive Letter Management

The application automatically manages drive letters to prevent conflicts:
- **Auto-Assignment**: Automatically assigns available drive letters when adding new mounts
- **Conflict Resolution**: If a drive letter is already in use, automatically selects the next available one
- **Duplicate Handling**: When loading from `mounts.json`, duplicates are automatically resolved
- **Dynamic Updates**: Drive letter dropdowns update in real-time based on availability

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>❌ Application crashes on mount</b></summary>

- ✅ Ensure Dokan Driver is properly installed
- ✅ Run the application as Administrator
- ✅ Check `mount_error.log` in the application directory for details
- ✅ Verify the source path exists and is accessible

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>💾 Drive letter not available</b></summary>

- ✅ Make sure the drive letter is not already in use
- ✅ Check Windows Disk Management for assigned letters
- ✅ Try a different drive letter

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🚫 Application won't start</b></summary>

- ✅ Verify .NET 8.0 Runtime is installed
- ✅ Check `crash.log` in the application directory
- ✅ Ensure you're running as Administrator
- ✅ Try running from command line to see error messages

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⚠️ Already running message appears</b></summary>

This is normal behavior. The application uses single-instance mode:
- If the window is hidden in tray, it will be restored automatically
- If the window is already visible, the existing instance continues running

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⏱️ Unmount is taking a long time</b></summary>

If unmount takes longer than expected:
- ✅ Close any programs accessing files on the drive (Explorer, cmd, etc.)
- ✅ Wait for the timeout dialog to show processes using the drive
- ✅ Choose to continue waiting or let it complete in background
- ✅ The drive will unmount automatically when all file handles are released
